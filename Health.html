<h1 style="color:red"> Health </h1><br>
<p>For every individual, it is important to lead a healthy life. The 7th of April has been declared as “World Health Day by” the World Health Organization (WHO) in view of creating awareness about the importance of health. To stay healthy, it is important to understand the actual meaning of health and hygiene. Let us learn more about it.

The WHO defines health as – “a complete state of physical, mental and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.” That is to say, a person cannot be termed healthy merely by being in a disease-free state. Physical and mental health are equally important and require a hygienic condition. Health and hygiene are two terms that are correlated.

<h2 style="color:tomato"> Hygiene </h2>
<p> Hygiene can be outlined as the practice of a few habits in order to maintain good health, overall. Maintenance of hygiene can be at the community level (social hygiene) or personal level (personal hygiene).
<br>
Personal hygiene: It covers physical exercise, cleanliness, sleep, proper rest and other related practices such as keeping away from consuming alcohol, smoking, drugs etc. Many diseases can be prevented to a great extent just by maintaining good personal hygiene.
<br>
Social hygiene: The surrounding and other public places around us are our society. An individual’s mental and physical condition is greatly influenced by a good environment. Improper, unkempt and untidy surroundings and inappropriate ways of waste disposal in public places results in the unhealthy surrounding. Such practices can cause an alarming growth of rodents, pathogens and other microbes, which can make us unwell. Consequently, both social and personal hygiene are vital aspects.</p> <br>
<h2 style="color:red"> Disease </h2>
<p> A disease causes us discomfort or an uneasy feeling, which may or may not necessarily give a pain sensation. Although “disease-free” and “being healthy” are terms that are often correlated, they are completely different. There is more to “being healthy” than just being “disease-free”. Certain signs and symptoms are used to diagnose a particular disease. And, presence of a particular disease can lead to an unhealthy life.</p> <br>
<h2 style="color:blue"> Healthy Habits for Good Hygiene </h2>
<br>

<p>The foremost step to keep yourself clean and healthy is bathing every-day. Regular bathing helps remove all the germs, dirt and sweat from your body. It also refreshes your body and mind.</p><br>

<p>  Needless to say, your hands carry a maximum number of germs. Therefore, it is essential for you to keep your hands clean. You should make it a habit of always cleaning your hands with soap or hand wash. You can also wash your hands by using alcohol-based sanitizing gel. It is recommended to wash your hands after visiting toilets, after coughing, sneezing, before preparing food and after consuming it.</p><br>
<h4> 3.Trimming your nails </h4>
<p> Appropriate hand hygiene includes meticulous cleaning and trimming of fingernails and toenails. Your nails may harbor dirt and germs contributing to the spread of infections. Finger-nails should be kept short and should be cleaned frequently with soap and water.</p><br>
<h4> 4.Practicing good oral hygiene </h4>

<h4> 5.Practicing sleep hygiene </h4>
<p> Getting a full night’s sleep (approximately 8 hours a night) is extremely important to achieve overall health and happiness. This is can be done by following a good sleeping pattern. Sleep hygiene is a set of rituals that you implement each day to get great sleep at night and to feel refreshed during the day.

While you sleep, your mind and body are busy restoring cells, energy and rebuilding tissue. Lack of sleep can leave you feeling lethargic. It can further compromise your body’s natural defenses- your immune system. You can practice good sleep hygiene by:

<h4> 6.Using deodorants for freshness </h4>

<h4> 7.Cleaning earwax </h4>

<br>
<h4> 1. Diabetes </h4>
<p> Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood sugar. Hyperglycaemia, or raised blood sugar, is a common effect of uncontrolled diabetes and over time leads to serious damage to many of the body's systems, especially the nerves and blood vessels.</p> <br>

<h4> 2. High B.P </h4>
<p> Blood pressure is the force exerted by circulating blood against the walls of the body’s arteries, the major blood vessels in the body. Hypertension is when blood pressure is too high.

Blood pressure is written as two numbers. The first (systolic) number represents the pressure in blood vessels when the heart contracts or beats. The second (diastolic) number represents the pressure in the vessels when the heart rests between beats.

Hypertension is diagnosed if, when it is measured on two different days, the systolic blood pressure readings on both days is ≥140 mmHg and/or the diastolic blood pressure readings on both days is ≥90 mmHg. </p><br>

<h4> 3. Cancer</h4>
<p>Cancer is a disease in which some of the body’s cells grow uncontrollably and spread to other parts of the body. 

Cancer can start almost anywhere in the human body, which is made up of trillions of cells. Normally, human cells grow and multiply (through a process called cell division) to form new cells as the body needs them. When cells grow old or become damaged, they die, and new cells take their place.</p><br>

<h4> 4. Thyroid </h4>
<p>Thyroid disease is a general term for a medical condition that keeps your thyroid from making the right amount of hormones. Your thyroid typically makes hormones that keep your body functioning normally. When the thyroid makes too much thyroid hormone, your body uses energy too quickly. This is called hyperthyroidism. Using energy too quickly will do more than make you tired — it can make your heart beat faster, cause you to lose weight without trying and even make you feel nervous. On the flip-side of this, your thyroid can make too little thyroid hormone. This is called hypothyroidism. When you have too little thyroid hormone in your body, it can make you feel tired, you might gain weight and you may even be unable to tolerate cold temperatures.

These two main disorders can be caused by a variety of conditions. They can also be passed down through families (inherited).</p><br>

<h4> 5. Migrane </h4>
<p>A migraine is a headache that can cause severe throbbing pain or a pulsing sensation, usually on one side of the head. It's often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and extreme sensitivity to light and sound. Migraine attacks can last for hours to days, and the pain can be so severe that it interferes with your daily activities.

For some people, a warning symptom known as an aura occurs before or with the headache. An aura can include visual disturbances, such as flashes of light or blind spots, or other disturbances, such as tingling on one side of the face or in an arm or leg and difficulty speaking.

Medications can help prevent some migraines and make them less painful. The right medicines, combined with self-help remedies and lifestyle changes, might help. </p><br>

<h4> 6. Paralysis </h4>
<p> Paralysis occurs when you’re unable to make voluntary muscle movements. A nervous system problem causes paralysis.

Uninjured nerves send signals to muscles. Those signals make muscles move. When you’re paralyzed, or have paralysis, you can’t move certain parts of your body.</p><br>

<h4> 7. Viral Fevers </h4>
<p> Viral fever is an umbrella term for a group of viral infections that affect the body and is characterized by high fever, burning in the eyes, headaches, body aches and sometimes nausea and vomiting.

Viral fever is common among children and older people as their immunity is lower. The fever by itself is not an illness, it is a symptom of an underlying cause, which is a viral infection. A viral infection can occur in any part of the body, intestines, lungs, air passages etc. The fever will occur as a result of the infection. The high fever is usually a sign of the immune system of the body, fighting against the intruding viruses and “burning them off”.

Many people tend to self-medicate, sometimes even by taking antibiotics, when they have an intermittent high fever with chills, which is a bad idea. Antibiotics cannot kill viruses. They kill harmful bacteria. Antibiotics, if taken unnecessarily can affect your stomach lining, kill the good gut bacteria, cause acidity and damage your liver and kidneys.

If you come down with fever, which is < 103 F/40 C, and it shows no signs of abating, it will be wise to consult your family doctor or visit a general practitioner and get yourself checked.</p><br>
